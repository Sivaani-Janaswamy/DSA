# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

 __Implementation and Common Patterns:__
 
This repository consists of mostly easy-medium problems' solutions to various data structures and algorithms and as well as implementation of common data structures in the Java programming language. This includes problems on arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees and graphs. Common patterns and algorithms will be given in-depth explanation. This is limited to medium-hard problems. Explanation for common patterns like sliding window, two pointers, BFS, DFS and other similar patterns will be provided.
The problems are beginner friendly. Learners are advised to first understand the problem and try solving it by their own. If they are having difficulty solving the problem, they could look at the algorithm given above each problem' solution and try to implement it in code.

> Contributions are welcome.
